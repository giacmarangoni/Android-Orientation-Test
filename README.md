# Android-Orientation-Test
An android orientation problem.

Clone this project, build and run. Turn your device in landscape mode and then open a new activity.
You will notice that orientation will turn automatically to landscape mode (even though landscape it's disabled on smartphones thanks to  ```portrait_only``` property contained in bool.xml) and, after a while, It will come back to portrait mode.

## Additional notes

```
android:screenOrientation
```

This property cannot be used in order to preserve portrait or landscape orientation on tablets.
